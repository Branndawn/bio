            <p>My grandfather changed my life.  Even though I could only visit him once a year, I would always remember every visit.  He was very patient, funny, and he was extremely helpful.  I remember coming up north to his house and helping him crush soda cans with a compressor that he made.  That was so much fun to do and it never got old.</p>

   			<p>He would volunteer to mow the grass each week for the church nearby. He would always crack jokes especially for tough times just to lift everyone's mood.  He never took the small things in life for granted either.  He loved to go outside even for being old.  He planted his own garden and grew his own vegetables to eat.  Early on when I was younger, he taught me a few moral lessons about being patient for things.  </p>

   			<p>He lived in Green Bay, Wisconsin, along with the rest of my family.  The culture there all surrounds the Green Bay Packers (The best team in football).  Green Bay Packers is the only team that is owned by the people, thats one reason why I love it.  THe other reason is because Green Bay is a great place.  When I visit my family, the summers are always cool and never go above 80 degrees.  They dont have the humidity that we have here in Memphis.</p>

   			<p>The people in Green Bay act a lot more different than in Memphis.  People in Memphis are rude and they are known to steal things.  The people in Green Bay on the other hand are nice, return something that you drop, and act like they are in a small city, or give off a community feeling.  I think that is one reason why my grandparents are the way they are (and I'm glad for that).</p>

   			<p>Grandpa Al would always say jokes that what you'd expect a grandfather to say.  His jokes were full of puns and dry humor.  Even if I had the worst day ever, his jokes would always bring my spirit up.  He had some funny sayings that would make us still say "You know what Grandpa Al would say...".  He was such a great guy, he would keep his optimism no matter what.  I went out bowling with my Dad and I missed half of the pins on my first try, but my dad said "You know what Grandpa Al would say, 'Go for the bunch!'"  Hearing that just makes me laugh everytime.</p>

            <p>Grandpa Al and my Dad really influenced who I am today.  My father would always remind me of funny things Grandpa Al would do.  Grandpa Al was so fun to visit everytime I was there.  I'm glad I could see him atleast once a year, because he was such a great guy.  My father and I still talk about him every once in a while and that just shows how great of a guy he was.  I'm really glad to have known about Grandpa Al.</p>
